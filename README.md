I'm currently a Robotics PhD student at the University of Utah working at the [Human Robot Empowerment Lab](https://hrelab.mech.utah.edu/) under [Professor Laura Hallock](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9D82kRYAAAAJ&hl=en)

I've graduated with a masters degree in Robotics from the University of Pennsylvania working under [Professor Michelle Johnson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Bdlf-Z4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at the [Rehab Robotics Lab](https://www.med.upenn.edu/rehabilitation-robotics-lab/) and have an undergraduate degree in Mechatronics from Manipal University.

I also have experience working at as a research engineer for the Rehab Robotics Lab and Recupero Robotics to design novel robotic solutions to augment rehabilitation interactions.

🤖 I’m currently working on

- Leveraging human sensing (EMG, force-torque sensing, sonomyography and motion capture) to build more effective end-effector rehabilitation robot systems.
- Characterizing neuromuscular human movement to enable personalized and targeted rehabilition.
- Creating more effective robot controllers and path planning algorithms to facilitate rehabilitative movements
